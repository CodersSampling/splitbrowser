Split Browser
=============

Split Browser is a minimalistic, ultra-lightweight, open source web browser for desktop, based on [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) (provided by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)), [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht/) and a native [webview](https://webview.dev/) (WebKit on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux, Edge WebView2 on Windows), with split screen (tiled) view, made with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

Every variant of Split Browser (WebKit, Ultralight, native webview) uses <100 MB of RAM to show the home page, which is much less than Chrome/Firefox/Edge. It also allows you to tile web pages side-by-side by dragging and dropping tabs.

Split Browser is in the alpha stage and provides only basic web browsing features, but no bookmarks, no history, no extensions, no advanced settings.

## Download

You can download the latest binary for Windows in the [releases](https://github.com/niutech/splitbrowser/releases). Keep in mind, this is an alpha version, so use at your own risk!

## Build

This project is being developed on Windows 10 using Qt 5.14, MSVC 2017 and qmake, but it should also run on Linux and macOS, provided that you have downloaded the lastest [Ultralight SDK](https://github.com/ultralight-ux/Ultralight#getting-the-latest-sdk) and [Playwright WebKit binaries](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) for your platform. Extract them to folders: `../ultralight` and `../webkit` relative to `splitbrowser`, open this project in Qt Creator and run it.
